# Engineering-Education-Scheme
I did this project as part of a team of four during my a-levels. It was external to my a-levels and involved correspondence on a real life project with the company NES and their engineers. I also submitted it as an extended project which received an A* grade. I contriubted to the design ideas part of this project, and then my main role was designing and writing the software which controlled the motion of four synchronous motors, in a variation of C/C++ for arduino. 

This project involved: 
•	Development of design ideas based on a brief for a nuclear waste retrieval mechanism 
•	Programming the synchronous control of four motors using an adaption of C/C++
•	Testing and debugging 
•	Costing and sourcing materials  
•	Report writing and presenting to a panel of senior engineers 
•	Working as a team of four with regular meetings with NES engineers
